# git

Fast, scalable, distributed revision control system.

This project provides python wheels for git. GNU make doesn't have builtin
support for cross compilation on macOS and Windows like xmake. So the wheels for
macOS on amd64 and Windows for arm64 are missing.

Attached perl/python/tcl/sh scripts cannot work, because their depends on
perl/python/tcl/sh.

See [xmake-python](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-python#autotoolsmakefile).
